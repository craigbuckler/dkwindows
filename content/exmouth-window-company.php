<p>Although much of our work involves <a href="[[<?php echo $link['windows']; ?>]]">double glazed windows</a>, <a href="[[<?php echo $link['conservatories']; ?>]]">conservatories</a> and <a href="[[<?php echo $link['doors']; ?>]]">door installations</a>, Dave is one of few expert glaziers in the Exmouth and East Devon area. He specialises in <a href="[[<?php echo $link['glazing']; ?>]]">traditional glazing methods</a> such as puttying.</p>

<h2>About Dave Kavanagh</h2>
<p><img src="[[root]]images/dave-kavanagh.jpg" width="105" height="79" alt="David Kavanagh" class="photo" />After a brief spell in the British Army, I moved to Exmouth with my parents in 1989 and helped them relocate their business <a href="https://www.wilsonspaints.co.uk/">&#8220;Wilsons Paints&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly after, I started work on the trawlers from Exmouth Docks in 1991. I absolutely loved working on the boats but, after suffering the loss of several work mates during a storm, I decided it was time to start a safer career on land.</p>

<p>In 1995, I began my life as a window fitter and glazier for MPS in Exmouth. I worked hard and developed my glazing knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>Finally, in 2007, I founded [[COMPANY]] &ndash; <strong>Exmouth&#8217;s best independant window fitter</strong>. Read more about the <a href="[[<?php echo $link['promise']; ?>]]">[[COMPANY]] promise to you&hellip;</a></p>
