<p>We offer a wide range of conservatories, designed and built around your home.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important part of the conservatory is the roof; it has to withstand snow, wind loading, heavy-handed window cleaners and remain weather-proof for the life of the conservatory. Our roofs are designed and manufactured by Ultraframe. All Ultraframe roofs are engineered for the extremes of the UK climate and are approved by the British Board of Agreement (BBA) to last at least 25 years. They are also the only system to have passed the USA&#8217;s BOCA system; the toughest testing regime in the world.</p>
