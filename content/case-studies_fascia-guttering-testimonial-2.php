<h2>Replacement Fascias, Soffits, Gutters &amp; Downpipes, March 2011</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>On 3 March 2011, Mrs H of Exmouth contacted us for a quote to replace the fascias, soffits and guttering on the front and rear of her home. She was happy with our quote so we arranged the installation for 11 March.</p>

<h2>Installation Obstacles</h2>

This would normally be a straight-forward job, however, the old fascias, soffits and gutters were made of asbestos. Asbestos removal is potentially harmful if not handled and disposed of correctly.

We had to ensure that we had all the appropriate protective clothing and equipment before we started to disturb the materials. A hose was used to soak the asbestos before breaking it into manageable pieces without creating harmful dust. The asbestos was securely wrapped and disposed of safely.

<h2>Customer Testimonial</h2>

<p>Mrs H was very happy and her husband commented that it made the house look as good as new! They were so happy with [[COMPANY]] service, that they even accepted another quote for a replacement window from us.</p>
