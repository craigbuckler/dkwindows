</li>

<li>
<p><strong>There are no hidden costs.</strong></p>
<p>Your quote is &#8216;all inclusive&#8217; &ndash; prices include VAT (where appropriate), there are no hidden costs, sales gimmicks, or nasty surprises.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Products are exactly as described.</strong></p>
<p>Every door, window, conservatory, fascia and gutter is ordered to your exact requirements and installed with meticulous care and attention to detail. Every job will be finished to perfection with a sprinkle of [[COMPANY]] magic!</p>
</li>

<li>
<blockquote>
<p>we ensure your installation proceeds as smoothly as possible</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We respect your property.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that inviting workmen into your home can be a horrifying thought! We ensure your installation proceeds as smoothly as possible, with the upmost respect to you, your home and your belongings.</p>

<p>When possible, we complete one room at a time and use dustsheets to protect carpets and furniture. We appreciate you moving ornaments and plants but we can move furniture and bulky objects if necessary. We always clean up afterwards and leave every room as we found it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>We respect you and your neighbours.</strong></p>
<p>Work often requires noisy power tools but we always keep disruption to a minimum to avoid disturbing to you and your neighbours.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Our 10 year guarantee.</strong></p>
<p>Every window, door and conservatory installation is provided with a 10-year guarantee. In the unlikely event of a problem with the product or the way it was installed, just <a href="[[<?php echo $link['contact']; ?>]]">contact us</a> and we will put it right. In addition, you have the reassurance of our 10 year insurance-backed guarantee from the <a href="http://www.ggf.co.uk/">Glass and Glazing Federation</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>We are a FENSA-registered window company.</strong></p>
<p>All relevant installations are issued with an important <a href="http://www.fensa.org.uk/">FENSA certificate</a>. This is a compulsory document which proves your installation conforms to all current building regulations. It can be kept with the deeds to your home and is required if you sell your home.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>We have &pound;5 million public liability insurance.</strong></p>
<p>Our insurance gives you further peace of mind when entrusting your home to us. <em>(Please ask if you wish to see a copy of any insurance or registration certificate)</em>.</p>
