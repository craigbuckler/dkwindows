<h1>[[PAGETITLE]]</h1>
<h2>Full Double Glazing Installation, November 2010</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>Mr &amp; Mrs C were already customers of [[COMPANY]] after we fitted a new front door and completed window repairs at their old house.</p>

<p>They moved house in 2010 and asked us to provide a quote for replacing all double-glazed windows and doors. They also requested quotations from several other window companies to ensure they received the best value for money. Mr &amp; Mrs C chose [[COMPANY]] because they were pleased with our price, familiar with our products, and had experienced our high level of quality workmanship.</p>

<h2>Installation Obstacles</h2>

<p>One of the existing windows in the property had beautiful decorative lead and colour work to the glass. It was old, so it was difficult to create an exact replica. However, we managed to match the style and colours well.</p>

<p>Mr &amp; Mrs C also decided to replace a rear window with a set of French doors. The lower section of bricks was removed and we decorated the inside to a high standard to complete the look.</p>

<p>Since they had young children, Mr &amp; Mrs C were concerned about safety. We therefore included safety-toughened glass in all panes and child restrictors to all opening sashes. (This is usually only necessary in locations where the windows are less than 800mm from the floor).</p>

<h2>Customer Testimonial</h2>

<p>Mr &amp; Mrs C were very happy with the updated appearance of their home and remarked how well the new doors and windows kept them warm through the cold winter of 2010/11.</p>
