<p>We use specialist traditional methods such as puttying which allows us to replace glass in different types of frame including stonework as you might find in a church. Dave is one of a handful of expert glaziers in Devon. With his knowledge, imagination and creative ability, he is able to design and create structures which other glass and glazing companies couldn&#8217;t even consider. One customer described his talents as <em>&#8220;genius&#8221;</em>.</p>

<p>Glass can be supplied in various types, sizes, styles and thicknesses according to their purpose. We work with single sheet glass, double glazed units and sometimes triple glazed units for flawless thermal efficiency and value.</p>
