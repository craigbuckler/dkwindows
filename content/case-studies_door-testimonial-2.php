<h1>[[PAGETITLE]]</h1>
<h2>Installation of New Door &amp; Two Sidelights</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>Miss B, a new customer of ours from Exmouth, asked DK Glass &amp; Windows to supply and fit a new uPVC door with two sidelights.</p>

<p>She contacted us after her existing uPVC door had broken its welds after it flew open in strong winds. Unfortunately, the previous door was not of good quality and no longer covered under a guarantee. After Miss B called us, we measured and quoted for a new door on the 25<sup>th</sup> January. Her new door was fitted on 10<sup>th</sup> February.</p>

<h2>Installation Obstacles</h2>

<p>The door was relatively simple to install although there were a few issues to consider. The door had to open outward because there was not enough room inside. To prevent further wind damage, Dave installed a 90&#176; stay to stop the door hitting the wall.</p>

<p>Following discussions with Miss B, two sidelights were fitted either side of the door rather than a single large one. This gave the door extra character and proved a more practical option for the space available.</p>

<h2>Customer Testimonial</h2>

<p>Miss B sent [[COMPANY]] the following letter:</p>

<section class="letter">
<p>Dear Mr Kavanagh,</p>

<p>I would like to express my gratitude to you for providing me with excellent service when I needed a new front door recently.</p>

<p>We arranged an appointment for you to attend my property and discuss my requirements, you arrived at the allocated time, you listened to what I wanted and inspected the damaged door, you then advised me what you thought was the best option and didn&#8217;t try to push any more expensive goods than was needed. You were very helpful and obviously knew what you were talking about.</p>

<p>I looked at your website and saw something slightly different and when I asked you if it would be possible to have it you were more than helpful and that is what we agreed on. You sent a further quote which was very acceptable to me so we agreed a date for you to come and replace my damaged door.</p>

<p>The quality of your doors are excellent, the security features are very, very good. I would also like to add that even though the weather was terrible, you arrived on time, proceeded to remove the old door and glazed panels and clean up behind you. You then fitted the new panels and door again cleaning up after you.</p>

<p>I was very impressed with you and your company and wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to recommend you to anyone.</p>

<p>Thank you once again.</p>
