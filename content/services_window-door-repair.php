<p>You may experience the following problems with older double-glazed windows, doors, conservatories, fascias and guttering:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>few window companies offer a repair service; it could save you thousands</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>cracked glass or uPVC</li>
<li>condensation between window panes</li>
<li>loose or damaged hinges</li>
<li>broken handles</li>
<li>faulty locks</li>
<li>lost keys</li>
<li>dirty or blocked gutters</li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you need to spend thousands of pounds replacing all doors and windows. In many cases, issues can be rectified quickly and cheaply by repairing or replacing faulty parts. In some cases, your windows may be covered under the original guarantee so parts may be free.</p>
